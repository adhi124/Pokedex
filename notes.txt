Code Problems:
Fixed filter overlapping issues - now filters can combine and work the way they are intended to.
Fixed bugs in which pokemon with certain characters did not load an image or caused the app to crash because of the array search call + glide call

Design Notes:
went with a combination of the expanded RV design and the standard description-title-icon-temperature design.
Also took the icons from the list of icons on dribble
